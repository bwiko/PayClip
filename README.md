# PayClip
 PayClip is a simple yet powerful tool for penetration testers and bug bounty hunters. It lets you organize payloads into categories (e.g., XSS, SQLi, XXE, etc.) and quickly copy them with a single click. No more digging through text filesâ€”everything you need is neatly organized and ready to use from one interface.
